3.2
---

**May 2, 2024**

### New features

- New `-limit N` action that quits immediately after `N` results

- Implemented `-context` (from GNU find) for matching SELinux contexts ([#27](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/27))

- Implemented `-printf %Z` for printing SELinux contexts

### Changes

- The build system has been rewritten, and there is now a configure step:

      $ ./configure
      $ make

  See `./configure --help` or [docs/BUILDING.md](/docs/BUILDING.md) for more details.

- Improved platform support
  - Implemented `-acl` on Solaris/Illumos
  - Implemented `-xattr` on DragonFly BSD

### Bug fixes

- Fixed some rarely-used code paths that clean up after allocation failures

3.1.3
-----

**March 6, 2024**

### Bug fixes

- On Linux, the `io_uring` feature probing introduced in `bfs` 3.1.2 only applied to one thread, causing all other threads to avoid using io_uring entirely.
  The probe results are now copied to all threads correctly.
  ([`f64f76b`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/f64f76b55400b71e8576ed7e4a377eb5ef9576aa))


3.1.2
-----

**February 29, 2024**

### Bug fixes

- On Linux, we now check for supported `io_uring` operations before using them, which should fix `bfs` on 5.X series kernels that support `io_uring` but not all of `openat()`/`close()`/`statx()` ([`8bc72d6`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/8bc72d6c20c5e38783c4956c4d9fde9b3ee9140c))

- Fixed a test failure triggered by certain filesystem types for `/tmp` ([#131](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/131))

- Fixed parsing and interpretation of timezone offsets for explicit reference times used in `-*since` and `-newerXt` ([`a9f3cde`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/a9f3cde30426b546ba6e3172e1a7951213a72049))

- Fixed the build on m68k ([`c749c11`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/c749c11b04444ca40941dd2ddc5802faed148f6a))


3.1.1
-----

**February 16, 2024**

### Changes

- Performance and scalability improvements

- The file count in `bfs -status` now has a thousands separator


3.1
---

**February 6, 2024**

### New features

- On Linux, `bfs` now uses [io_uring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring) for async I/O

- On all platforms, `bfs` can now perform `stat()` calls in parallel, accelerating queries like `-links`, `-newer`, and `-size`, as well as colorized output

- On FreeBSD, `-type w` now works to find whiteouts like the system `find`

### Changes

- Improved `bfs -j2` performance ([`b2ab7a1`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/b2ab7a151fca517f4879e76e626ec85ad3de97c7))

- Optimized `-exec` by using `posix_spawn()` when possible, which can avoid the overhead of `fork()` ([`95fbde1`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/95fbde17a66377b6fbe7ff1f014301dbbf09270d))

- `-execdir` and `-okdir` are now rejected if `$PATH` contains a relative path, matching the behaviour of GNU find ([`163baf1`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/163baf1c9af13be0ce705b133e41e0c3d6427398))

- Leading whitespace is no longer accepted in integer command line arguments like `-links ' 1'` ([`e0d7dc5`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/e0d7dc5dfd7bdaa62b6bc18e9c1cce00bbe08577))

### Bug fixes

- `-quit` and `-exit` could be ignored in the iterative deepening modes (`-S {ids,eds}`).
  This is now fixed ([`670ebd9`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/670ebd97fb431e830b1500b2e7e8013b121fb2c5)).
  The bug was introduced in version 3.0.3 (commit [`5f16169`]).

- Fixed two possible errors in sort mode (`-s`):
  - Too many open files ([`710c083`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/710c083ff02eb1cc5b8daa6778784f3d1cd3c08d))
  - Out of memory ([`76ffc8d`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/76ffc8d30cb1160d55d855d8ac630a2b9075fbcf))

- Fixed handling of FreeBSD union mounts ([`3ac3bee`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/3ac3bee7b0d9c9be693415206efa664bf4a7d4a7))

- Fixed `NO_COLOR` handling when it's set to the empty string ([`79aee58`](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/79aee58a4621d01c4b1e98c332775f3b87213ddb))

- Fixed some portability issues:
  - [OpenBSD](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/compare/ee200c07643801c8b53e5b80df704ecbf77a884e...79f1521b0e628be72bed3a648f0ae90b62fc69b8)
  - [NetBSD](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/compare/683f2c41c72efcb82ce866e3dcc311ac9bd8b66d...6435684a7d515e18247ae1b3dd9ec8681fee22d0)
  - [DragonFly BSD](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/compare/08867473e75e8e20ca76c7fb181204839e28b271...45fb1d952c3b262278a3b22e9c7d60cca19a5407)
  - [Illumos](https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/compare/4010140cb748cc4f7f57b0a3d514485796c665ce...ae94cdc00136685abe61d55e1e357caaa636d785)


3.0.4
-----

**October 12, 2023**

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a segfault when reporting errors under musl ([`d40eb87`])

[`d40eb87`]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/commit/d40eb87cc00f50a5debb8899eacb7fcf1065badf


3.0.3
-----

**October 12, 2023**

### Changes

- Iterative deepening modes (`-S {ids,eds}`) were optimized by delaying teardown until the very end ([`5f16169`])

- Parallel depth-first search (`-S dfs`) was optimized to avoid enqueueing every file separately ([`2572273`])

### Bug fixes

- Iterative deepening modes (`-S {ids,eds}`) were performing iterative *breadth*-first searches since `bfs` 3.0, negating any advantages they may have had over normal breadth-first search.
  They now do iterative *depth*-first searches as expected.
  ([`a029d95`])

- Fixed a linked-list corruption that could lead to an infinite loop on macOS and other non-Linux, non-FreeBSD platforms ([`773f4a4`])

3.0.2
-----

**September 6, 2023**

### Changes

- `-files0-from` now allows an empty set of paths to be given, matching GNU findutils 4.9.0

- Reduced memory consumption in multi-threaded searches

- Many man page updates

### Bug fixes

- Fixed an out-of-bounds memory read that could occur when escaping a string containing an incomplete multi-byte character


3.0.1
-----

**July 18, 2023**

### Bug fixes

- Traversal fixes that mostly affect large directory trees ([#107])

  - `bfs` could encounter `EMFILE`, close a file, and retry many times, particularly with `-j1`

  - Breadth-first search could become highly unbalanced, negating many of the benefits of `bfs`

  - On non-{Linux,FreeBSD} plaforms, directories could stay open longer than necessary, consuming extra memory

[#107]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/pull/107


3.0
---

**July 13, 2023**

### New features

- `bfs` now reads directories asynchronously and in parallel ([#101]).
  Performance is significantly improved as a result.
  Parallelism is controlled by the new `-j` flag, e.g. `-j1`, `-j2`, etc.

[#101]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/101

### Changes

- `bfs` now uses the [C17] standard version, up from C11

- Due to [#101], `bfs` now requires some additional C and POSIX features:
  - [Standard C atomics] (`<stdatomic.h>`)
  - [POSIX threads] (`<pthread.h>`)

- `$LS_COLORS` extensions written in different cases (e.g. `*.jpg=35:*.JPG=01;35`) are now matched case-sensitively, to match the new behaviour of GNU ls since coreutils version 9.2

- Added a warning/error if `$LS_COLORS` can't be parsed, depending on whether `-color` is requested explicitly

- Filenames with control characters are now escaped when printing with `-color`

- Build flags like `WITH_ONIGURUMA` have been renamed to `USE_ONIGURUMA`

[C17]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/17
[Standard C atomics]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic
[POSIX threads]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/threads.html

### Bug fixes

- Fixed handling of the "normal text" color (`no` in `$LS_COLORS`) to match GNU ls

- Fixed running the tests as root on Linux [`8b24de3`]

- Fixed some tests on Android [`2724dfb`] [`0a5a80c`]

- Stopped relying on non-POSIX touch(1) features in the tests.
  This should fix the tests on at least OpenBSD.
  [`2d5edb3`]

- User/group caches are now filled lazily instead of eagerly [`b41dca5`]

- More caches and I/O streams are flushed before -exec/-ok [`f98a1c4`]

- Fixed various memory safety issues found by fuzzing \
  [`712b137`] [`5ce883d`] [`da02def`] [`c55e855`]

2.6.2
-----

**October 21, 2022**

- Fixed use of uninitialized memory on parsing errors involving `-fprintf`

- Fixed Android build issues ([#96])

- Refactored the test suite

[#96]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/96


2.6.1
-----

**July 7, 2022**

- Fix `stat()` errors on GNU Hurd systems with glibc older than 2.35

- Added fish shell tab completion ([#94]).
  Thanks @xfgusta!

[#94]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/pull/94


2.6
---

**May 21, 2022**

- Fixed deleting large NFS directories on FreeBSD ([#67]).

- Added support for a `bfs`-specific `BFS_COLORS` environment variable.

- Refactored the build system, directory structure, and documentation ([#88], [#89], [#91]).
  Thanks @ElectronicsArchiver!

- Added `zsh` completion ([#86]).
  Thanks @VorpalBlade!

- Updated the default color scheme to match GNU coreutils 9.1.
  Files with capabilities set are no longer colored differently by default, resulting in a significant performance improvement.

- Became less aggressive at triggering automounts

- Added support for out-of-tree builds with `BUILDDIR`

2.5
---

**March 27, 2022**

- Added compiler-style context for errors and warnings.
  Errors look like this:

      $ bfs -nam needle
      bfs: error: bfs -nam needle
      bfs: error:     ~~~~
      bfs: error: Unknown argument; did you mean -name?

  and warnings look like this:

      $ bfs -print -name 'needle'
      bfs: warning: bfs -print -name needle
      bfs: warning:            ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      bfs: warning: The result of this expression is ignored.

- Updated from C99 to C11

- Fixed the tests when built against musl

- Fixed a build error reported on Manjaro


2.4.1
-----

**February 24, 2022**

- Fixed the build when Oniguruma is not installed in the default search paths ([#82])

- Fixed string encoding bugs with Oniguruma enabled

- Fixed regex error reporting bugs

[#82]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/82


2.4
---

**February 22, 2022**

- Added the Oniguruma regular expression library as an (optional, but enabled by default) dependency ([#81]).
  Oniguruma supports more regular expression syntax types than the POSIX regex API, and often performs better.
  To build `bfs` without this new dependency, do `make WITH_ONIGURUMA=` to disable it.
  Thanks @data-man!

- Added support for the `ed`, `emacs`, `grep`, and `sed` regular expression types ([#21])

- Before executing a process with `-exec[dir]`/`-ok[dir]`, `bfs` now ensures all output streams are flushed.
  Previously, I/O from subprocesses could be interleaved unpredictably with buffered I/O from `bfs` itself.

[#21]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/21


2.3.1
-----

**January 21, 2022**

- Fixed the build on Debian kFreeBSD

- Fixed a crash on GNU Hurd when piping bfs's output

- Fixed a double-`close()` on non-Linux platforms if `fdopendir()` fails

- Reduced memory allocations on startup


2.3
---

**November 25, 2021**

- More tweaks to `PAGER` and `LESS` handling for `bfs -help` ([#76])

- Use 512-byte blocks for `-ls` when `POSIXLY_CORRECT` is set ([#77])

- Implemented `-files0-from FILE` to take a list of `'\0'`-separated starting paths.
  GNU find will implement the same feature in an upcoming release.

- Added colors to `-printf` output ([#62])

- Faster recovery from `E2BIG` during `-exec`

2.2.1
-----

**June 2, 2021**

- Fixed some incorrect coloring of broken links when links are being followed (`-L`)

- Made the tests work when run as root by dropping privileges.
  This may be helpful for certain packaging or CI environments, but is not recommended.

- Treat empty `PAGER` and `LESS` environment variables like they're unset, for `bfs -help` ([#71]).
  Thanks @markus-oberhumer!

- The soft `RLIMIT_NOFILE` is now raised automatically to a fairly large value when possible.
  This provides a minor performance benefit for large directory trees.

- Implemented time units for `-mtime` as found in FreeBSD find ([#75])

[#71]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/71
[#75]: https://github.com/tavianator/bfs/issues/75


2.2
---

**March 6, 2021**

- Fixed `-hidden` on hidden start paths

- Added a Bash completion script.
  Thanks @bmundt6!

- Fixed rounding in `-used`.
  Corresponding fixes were made to GNU find in version 4.8.0.

- Optimized the open directory representation.
  On Linux, much libc overhead is bypassed by issuing syscalls directly.
  On all platforms, a few fewer syscalls and open file descriptors will be used.

- Implemented `-flags` from BSD find


2.1
---

**November 11, 2020**

- Added a new `-status` option that displays the search progress in a bar at the bottom of the terminal

- Fixed an optimizer bug introduced in version 2.0 that affected some combinations of `-user`/`-group` and `-nouser`/`-nogroup`


2.0
---

**October 14, 2020**

- [#8]: New `-exclude <expression>` syntax to more easily and reliably filter out paths.
  For example:

      bfs -name config -exclude -name .git

  will find all files named `config`, without searching any directories (or files) named `.git`.
  In this case, the same effect could have been achieved (more awkwardly) with `-prune`:

      bfs ! \( -name .git -prune \) -name config

  But `-exclude` will work in more cases:

      # -exclude works with -depth, while -prune doesn't:
      bfs -depth -name config -exclude -name .git

      # -exclude applies even to paths below the minimum depth:
      bfs -mindepth 3 -name config -exclude -name .git

- [#30]: `-nohidden` is now equivalent to `-exclude -hidden`.
  This changes the behavior of command lines like

      bfs -type f -nohidden

  to do what was intended.

- Optimized the iterative deepening (`-S ids`) implementation

- Added a new search strategy: exponential deepening search (`-S eds`).
  This strategy provides many of the benefits of iterative deepening, but much faster due to fewer re-traversals.

- Fixed an optimizer bug that could skip `-empty`/`-xtype` if they didn't always lead to an action

- Implemented `-xattrname` to find files with a particular extended attribute (from macOS find)

- Made `-printf %l` still respect the width specifier (e.g. `%10l`) for non-links, to match GNU find

- Made `bfs` fail if `-color` is given explicitly and `LS_COLORS` can't be parsed, rather than falling back to non-colored output
